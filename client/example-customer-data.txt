In a database, the following should be stored for each customer:

General:
- Name                 [Ex: Whitmire Rescue Squad]
- Theme color          [Ex: #009fff (the other colors would be derived from this by darkening)]

Roles:                 [Admin and default user are always present, others are chosen by customer, each must have a color and set page permissions]
- Admin
	- Color            [Ex: #00bda7]
	- Permissions      [Always all pages]
- User
	- Color            [Ex: #5e5e5e]
	- Permissions      [Ex: inventory, incident records]
